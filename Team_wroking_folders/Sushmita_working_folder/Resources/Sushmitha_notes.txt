1. We can also include wind speed to our weather data
2. We can also use box plot to find incorrect data(Outliers) and as line graph(trend plot is already done)
3. Then we need to know how to fix the incorrect data 
4. After that we can build the data model 
5. We can even start with a familiar data model like linear regression model then go for Time series
