Group 5- Final project work


Hi Team - This is Maria and want to share the data that I found for the covid cases per big cities daily from May 2020 to May 2021.

The file name is **Comparativo-Ciudades** and includes the following information:

**Date/Country/City/Accumulative cases confirmed/ No. death / City population in millions / Cases per millon habitants / No. death per million habitants**

I was thinking we can compare *New york vs Sao Paulo* given than the population is similar but the seasons are opposite, while in New York is summer in Sao Paulo is Winter and viceversa.

We can do the same analysis for different cities, as the data is included in the [file](https://github.com/archinarula/Group-5-Project/blob/Maria/Comparativo-ciudades.csv)

The source of this data cna be found [here](https://saludata.saludcapital.gov.co/osb/index.php/datos-de-salud/enfermedades-trasmisibles/covid19/)

I also found the average daily temperature for major cities. You can find the link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities)
